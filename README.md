# Stock-price-predictions-using-Neural-Networks

The objective of this analysis is the implementation of neural network models for forecasting the opening prices of the JPM stock, of the investment bank JPMorgan & Chease. In particular, two network models have been implemented:
  - CNN model
  - Ecoder-Decoder CNN-LSTM model
  whose performances were also evaluated by changing some parameters of the network and compared with a Baseline model, such as ARIMA. Walk forward validation was used to obtain more accurate predictions. In conclusion, the best network that gave the most accurate predictions is CNN with two convolutional layers, but it still fails to achieve the performance obtained with the ARIMA model. Possible further developments for neural networks could be the use of information taken from information sites and the use of cointegrated series.
In the report, in Italian, there is the complete analysis.
